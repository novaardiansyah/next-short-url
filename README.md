# NextJs URL Shortener

Hi Future Developer, 

Welcome to my latest project! This time, I developed a simple web application for URL shortening and QR Code generation. Previously, I had a similar system, but it was based on an admin panel, which was less user-friendly for the public. Therefore, I decided to migrate and rebuild it using technologies that better suit the purpose. For the front-end, I chose Next.js v15 and Shadcn-UI, which is built on Tailwind CSS, to achieve a modern and responsive design. Additionally, I have introduced several feature improvements, including a subscription system for upcoming services on this platform. In the future, I also plan to provide detailed analytics and reports with a modern and informative presentation.
